# Hire-Me ðŸ¤“
 
*Hello, World!*

I'm at a new stage in my life. Iâ€™m moving forward in a Full Stack training and I have the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript modules completed. Iâ€™m constantly studying to get move involved with Angular, React, and Node. Besides, to complete the Frontend environment I got notions of Jquery and JSON. From Backend, I understand SQL, PHP (also Laravel), Agile and Scrum Frameworks. I had finished a Full Stack Developer Course at the end of 2019 and since this time, I keep myself motivated by doing exercises through game apps like Mimo app and Grasshopper, and to watch video classes, reading, and participating of webinars.

Iâ€™m motivated to get involved with programming, participate in teamwork, learn, and produce the best solutions to the most varied issues. I understand Kanban, Agile, Scrum frameworks, and last year I attended a workshop of design thinking. I feel prepared to accept challenges and receptive to news!

Recently, I updated my test/exercise page with some mini projects of HTML/CSS/JS to show some habilities. My latest work was on a Weather APP, where I used openweather api and I deployed at Github. Actually I'm finishing a "Bootcamp-Project" to build with React Native an app for Trash Containers for recycled items based on geolocation.  I have a degree in Journalism and a Master's in Advertising and Public Relations. I have already gone through advertising agencies, I had a startup whose focus was to develop customers within the digital medium through Social Networks and Content Creation. In this case, I am looking for an opportunity to take up an old passion that is programming, an area in which I started to study previously.

**YES! I'M READY. HIRE ME!**
