      <p>“Hello, World!”</p>
      <p>I'm at a new stage in my life. I’m moving forward in a Full Stack training and I have the HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript modules completed. I’m constantly studying to get move involved with Angular, React, and Node.
        Besides, to complete the Frontend environment I got notions of Jquery and JSON. From Backend, I understand SQL,
        PHP (also Laravel), Agile and Scrum Frameworks. I had finished a Full Stack Developer Course at the end of 2019
        and since this time, I keep myself motivated by doing exercises through game apps like Mimo app and Grasshopper,
        and to watch video classes, reading, and participating of webinars. </p>
      <p>I’m motivated to get involved with programming, participate in teamwork, learn, and produce the best solutions
        to the most varied issues. I understand Kanban, Agile, Scrum frameworks, and last year I attended a workshop of
        design thinking. I feel prepared to accept challenges and receptive to news! </p>

        <p>Recently, I updated my test/exercise page with some mini projects of HTML/CSS/JS to show some habilities. My
          latest work was on a Weather APP, where I used openweather api and I deployed at Github. Actually I'm
          finishing
          a "Bootcamp-Project" to build with React Native an app for Trash Containers for recycled items based on
          geolocation. 
          I have a degree in Journalism and a Master's in Advertising and Public Relations. I have already gone through
          advertising agencies, I had a startup whose focus was to develop customers within the digital medium through
          Social Networks and Content Creation. In this case, I am looking for an opportunity to take up an old passion
          that is programming, an area in which I started to study previously.</p>
